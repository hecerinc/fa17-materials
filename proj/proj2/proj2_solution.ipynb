    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it >=0.5 probability of being spam. However, we can adjust that cutoff: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it >=0.7 probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC (receiver operating charactistic) curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. We will discuss this during lecture, and you can also read [this blog post for more information.](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/what-is-an-roc-curve/).\n",
